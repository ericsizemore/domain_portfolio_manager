<h3>What is Domain Portfolio Manager?</h3>
<br />
<p>
	Domain Portfolio Manager is a FREE domain sales and portfolio management software. It is written in PHP and uses MySQL for its database backend. Domain Portfolio manager can help domain owners better organize their portfolio and generate sales leads. Domain Portfolio Manager allows you to list your domains with their expiry, registrar, price, status, category, and more; it also allows visitors to your portfolio to contact you about a given domain, or to contact you in general such as for website problems or advertising.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<br />
<p>
	My name is Eric Sizemore and I am <span id="currentage">23</span> years old.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	I am the original author of Domain Name Portfolio, which at one point resided at domainportfolio.us. It has recently been rebranded as DNSPortflio / DNSPortfolio.com. It was rebranded because on April 23rd, 2010 I sold the project to a guy by the name of Stephen Cox. He, in turn, sold the project to Stu Buckingham (the current owner) on June 21st, 2010. At this point, I technically no longer hold the copyright to the code behind Domain Name Portfolio (dnsportfolio).
</p>
<br />
<p>
	However, Domain Name Portfolio was originally released by me under the GPL, and it has always been GPL. So, with that in mind, I decided to continue development and form a new project called Domain Portfolio Manager. Domain Portfolio Manager is based on the unreleased, unsold, version 1.7.0 of Domain Name Portfolio. The GPL gives me the right to fork the software and build my own, which is what I plan to do.
</p>

<p>
	I hope you enjoy the software and feel free to let me know your thoughts, suggestions, or any problems you may have with the software.
	<br /><br />
	Regards,<br />
	Eric Sizemore
