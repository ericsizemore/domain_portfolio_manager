/**
* April 23rd, 2010: I sold Domain Name Portfolio 1.6.0 to Stephen Cox.
* June 21st, 2010 : Stephen sold it to Stu Buckingham. 
*
* As of June 21st, 2010 - Stu Buckingham technically is the copyright holder to DNP up to
* 1.6.x and he rebranded to DNS Portfolio.
*
* The script was originally created by me, Eric Sizemore, and has always been under
* the GNU GPL. So, with that in mind, I decided to continue development as the rights
* to 1.7.0 that was in development was not sold. Even with my rights to the code sold
* for previous versions, with the GPL, I still have the right to fork or continue development.
*
* After more than a year of different people coming to me, wanting me to continue working on 
* Domain Portfolio Manager, I finally decided to pick it back up again.
*
* So, this code now is based on the unreleased 1.7.0 I had, and has been re-versioned to start
* at 1.0.0. It's new name under me is: Domain Portfolio Manager.
*
* Enjoy. :)
