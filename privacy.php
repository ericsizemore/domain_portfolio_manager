/**
* April 23rd, 2010: I sold Domain Name Portfolio 1.6.0 to Stephen Cox.
* June 21st, 2010 : Stephen sold it to Stu Buckingham. 
*
* As of June 21st, 2010 - Stu Buckingham technically is the copyright holder to DNP up to
* 1.6.x and he rebranded to DNS Portfolio.
*
* After more than a year of different people coming to me, wanting me to continue working on 
* the script, I finally decided to pick it back up again. Since it is under the GNU GPL, I am 
* able to do so. My continuation of the script will be called Domain Portfolio Manager.
